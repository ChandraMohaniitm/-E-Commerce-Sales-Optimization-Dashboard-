ðŸš€ E-Commerce Sales Optimization Dashboard ðŸ“Š

I recently worked on building a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze and optimize e-commerce performance across multiple dimensions â€“ sales, returns, shipping, and customer behavior.

âœ¨ Key Highlights from the Dashboard:

 ðŸ”¹ Total Sales: $60.14M with an average order value of $1.21K.

 ðŸ”¹ Returns: 50K units returned â†’ Return Rate 9.83% (a critical area to optimize).

 ðŸ”¹ Top Performing Categories: Furniture, Apparel, Electronics â€“ each contributing over $10M in sales.

 ðŸ”¹ Returns Analysis: Most returned items include wall clocks, USB cables, and headphones. Both online & in-store channels show similar return trends.

 ðŸ”¹ Shipment Insights:

FedEx, UPS, DHL, and Royal Mail share sales almost equally (~25% each).

Average shipping cost: $17.49, with UPS being slightly more cost-efficient on returns (9.47%).

 ðŸ”¹ Geographical Insights: United States, Belgium, and Germany lead in sales (~5.1M each).

 ðŸ”¹ Warehouse Insights: Amsterdam, Rome, and Berlin are the top-performing warehouses with sales over $12M.

ðŸ’¡ Actionable Takeaways:

 âœ… Focus on reducing returns in Apparel & Electronics (high return rates).

 âœ… Optimize shipment costs by provider & warehouse location to increase margins.

 âœ… Explore why certain products (like USB cables & headphones) are frequently returned â€“ quality or expectation mismatch?

 âœ… Leverage customer payment method analysis â€“ PayPal shows a slightly higher return trend (10.04%).

ðŸ“Œ This dashboard is not just about numbers â€“ it tells a story of where the business is excelling and where it can improve. With these insights, decision-makers can streamline logistics, cut down return costs, and boost overall profitability.
